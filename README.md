# GitHub Profile Checker

## Description

The GitHub Profile Checker is a simple web application that allows users to enter a GitHub username and retrieve basic profile information about that user. The application displays the user's avatar, name, followers, following, location, and the number of public repositories. This project serves as a practical example of using asynchronous JavaScript (fetch API) to make API calls and handle JSON data, as well as applying CSS for styling and responsive design.

- Loading Indicator: A loading indicator that informs users when data is being fetched.
- Profile Information: Displays user avatar, name, followers, following, location, and public repositories.
- Responsive Design: Ensures the application looks good on various screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5: Structure of the application.
- CSS3: Styling and layout, including a GitHub-themed background.
- JavaScript (ES6): Fetch API for making asynchronous requests to the GitHub API.
- GitHub API: Source of profile data for GitHub users.
